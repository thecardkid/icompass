# About this app
This is an online, collaborative implementation of Ela Ben-Ur's design tool [**Innovators' Compass**](http://innovatorscompass.org). It's an attempt at reducing paper waste, while allowing more robust collaboration and storage.

# Non-User Oriented, Collaborative Design
The app does not ask you to create an account: this makes it faster to get started with it. This means that usernames are non-persistent, so you can sign in with different names each time. A compass is not attached to your username, since you as a user don't exist in the database.

When you join a workspace with editing rights, you are assigned a color for both your sticky notes and chat messages. Your color changes when you refresh the page, or log in from somewhere else.

When creating a compass, you can have me email you the codes. The email will come from innovatorscompass@yahoo.com. Yes, **yahoo.com**.
